## About Me

You need a brief overview about my skill-set and what drives me crazy :clown_face:? You're on the right page. :satisfied:

#### What drives me crazy :clown_face:
I'm enthusiastic fellow of the methodology of [DDD](https://github.com/ddd-crew) and addicted to create event driven architectures, cloud native :cloud:. Both combined allow us to build great sociotechnical systems.

#### iSAQB® CPSA® — Certified Professional for Software Architecture 
This year, I started a certification track to become an iSAQB® CPSA® — Certified Professional for Software Architecture Advanced Level. As today, I finalized all needed certifications and courses to be eligible to submit a detailed architectural work document. The document is currently work in progress.

#### Certifications
I also pass various other certifications and badges of honor. You will find a list scraped from my [Credly profile](https://www.credly.com/users/robin-konrad.1eb10cec/badges) below.

#### Beside work? 
I'm a great fan of the [Urban Arrow](https://urbanarrow.com/family-bikes/) biking community and drive nearly every possible kilometer by one of our urban arrows. :bike:
