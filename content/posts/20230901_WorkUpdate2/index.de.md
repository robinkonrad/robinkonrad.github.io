After 10 months working at [XEBIA | XPIRIT](https://www.xpirit.com), enabling our clients to build their unique engineering culture. I am thrilled to take on the new opportunity as Enterprise Architect at [WIPRO](https://www.wipro.com).

Many thanks for the opportunity to grow. Also, I would like to thank my colleagues for their valuable time, contributions, and work.

It was an awesome ride! Riding the rollercoaster of knowledge sharing, quality and people, just letting me grow both personally and professionally.

I am grateful for all the experiences of the last few months.
