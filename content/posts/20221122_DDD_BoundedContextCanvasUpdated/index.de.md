## Bounded Context Canvas
The impressive [DDD-Crew](https://github.com/ddd-crew) provides Version #5 of the [**Bounded Context Canvas**](https://github.com/ddd-crew/bounded-context-canvas) . A great collaborative tool for designing, documenting and discussion of a single bounded context.

## What's new?
With version 5 of the Bounded Context Canvas a few changes. Mostly smaller ones but really helpful in your daily work. :grinning:

### Description was renamed to Purpose
The previous called "Description" was renamed to "Purpose". 

### Field "Assumptions" added
You make any assumption during creating of the Bounded Context Canvas, make them explicit! Write them down and use the new field.

### Field "Verification Metrics" added
You love the build-measure-learn principle from the Lean community? Now you have a field to place your **Verification Metrics**, use the metrics to (in)valid assumptions. 

### Field "Open Questions" added
Still open questions? Now you have a specific field to put them.
