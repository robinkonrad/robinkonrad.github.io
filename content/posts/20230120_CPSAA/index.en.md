## I did it! :rocket:

After today's defense of thesis about web applications, I'm pleased to announce: I passed the exam and be certified as [iSAQB® Certified Professional for Software Architecture Advanced Level®](https://www.isaqb.org/certifications/cpsa-certifications/cpsa-advanced-level/).

## iSAQB® Certified Professional for Software Architecture Advanced Level®
The CPSA Advanced Level (CPSA-A®) is the next reasonable step after passing the [Foundation Level](https://www.isaqb.org/certifications/cpsa-certifications/cpsa-foundation-level/) and consists of a training mixture to gain knowledge in three areas of competence: methodology, technology and communication. 

Participants needs to gain at least 70 credit points within different modules to be allowed to register for the CPSA-A examination. Currently, the certification schedule consists of 17 modules to choose from, starting with [Architecture Documentation](https://www.isaqb.org/certifications/cpsa-certifications/cpsa-advanced-level/adoc-architecture-documentation/) and ending up with [Web Security](https://www.isaqb.org/certifications/cpsa-certifications/cpsa-advanced-level/websec/) The examination itself requires time and effort to fulfill the demands of expertise and experience to pass. 

If passed, you are able to:
- Design medium- and large-sized IT systems independently and with well-founded methods
- Assume technical and content-related responsibility for IT systems with medium to high criticality
- Conceptualize, design and document measures to achieve non-functional requirements
- Support development teams in the implementation of these measures
- Coordinate and perform architecture-relevant communication in medium-
to large-sized development teams
