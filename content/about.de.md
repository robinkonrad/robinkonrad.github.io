## Über mich

### iSAQB® CPSA® — Certified Professional for Software Architecture 
This year, I started a certification track to become an iSAQB® CPSA® — Certified Professional for Software Architecture Advanced Level. Currently, I finalized all needed certifications and courses to be eligible to submit a detailed architectural work document, currently work in progress.
