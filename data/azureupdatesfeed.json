The closer the PUE number is to &ldquo;1,&rdquo; the more efficient the use of energy.<br>\r\nWhile local environment and infrastructure can affect how PUE is calculated, there are also slight variations across providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the simplest way to think about PUE:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/230d538b-3ec7-4074-bb7a-4b57fc219c60.png\"><img alt=\"A picture of Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) calculation.\" border=\"0\" height=\"34\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/e9f361a2-d080-4946-ba20-425209d8a962.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"\" width=\"506\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WUE</strong> is another key metric relating to the efficient and sustainable operations of our datacenters and is a crucial aspect as we work towards our commitment to be <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/green-tech-blog/part-three-water-positive-zero-waste-and-ecosystems/ba-p/2224123\">water positive</a> by 2030. WUE is calculated by dividing the number of liters of water used for humidification and cooling by the total annual amount of power (measured in kWh) needed to operate our datacenter IT equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/31eb6438-316c-4b85-9cac-304dcc93223d.png\"><img alt=\"A picture of a Water Usage Effectiveness calculation.\" border=\"0\" height=\"37\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/e71ad504-c24e-4614-82cb-d2fcce56d1d4.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"\" width=\"579\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to PUE and WUE, below are key highlights across carbon, water, and waste initiatives at our datacenters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Datacenter efficiency in North and South America</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As I illustrated in April, our newest generation of datacenters have a design PUE of 1.12; this includes our Chile datacenter that is under construction. We are constantly focused on improving our energy efficiency, for example in California, our San Jose datacenters will be cooled with an indirect evaporative cooling system using reclaimed water all year and zero fresh water. Because the new datacenter facilities will be cooled with reclaimed water, they will have a WUE of 0.00 L/kWh in terms of freshwater usage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, as we continue our journey to achieve zero waste by 2030, we are proud of the progress we are making with our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcWg7F85puY\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Circular Centers</a>. These centers sit adjacent to a Microsoft datacenter and process decommissioned cloud servers and hardware. Our teams sort and intelligently channel the components and equipment to optimize, reuse or repurpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October, we launched a Circular Center in Chicago, Illinois that has the potential capacity to process up to 12,000 servers per month for reuse, diverting up to 144,000 servers annually. We plan to open a Circular Center in Washington state early next year and have plans for Circular Centers in Texas, Iowa, and Arizona to further optimize our supply chain and reduce waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, our team has successfully completed an important water reuse project at one of our datacenters. This treatment facility, <a href=\"https://local.microsoft.com/blog/partnering-with-the-city-of-quincy-to-open-washingtons-first-industrial-water-reuse-center/\">the first of its kind</a> in Washington state and over 10 years in the making, will process water for reuse by local industries, including datacenters, decreasing the need for potable water for datacenter cooling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Innovative solutions in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This winter Europeans face the possibility of an energy crisis, and we have made a number of investments in optimizing energy efficiency in our datacenters to ensure that we are operating our facilities as effectively as possible. Datacenters are the <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/europe/features/critical-to-our-modern-society-how-datacenters-power-everyday-necessities/\">backbone of modern society</a> and as such it is important that we continue to provide critical services to the industries that need us most in a way that constantly mitigates energy consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across our datacenters in EMEA, we have made steady progress across carbon, waste, water, and ecosystems. We are committed to shifting to 100 percent renewable energy supply by 2025, meaning that we will have power purchase agreements for green energy contracted for 100 percent of carbon emitting electricity consumed by all our data centers, buildings, and campuses. This will add additional gigawatts of renewable energy to the grid, increasing energy capacity. We&#39;re helping to add clean capacity to the grid by signing purchase agreements for more than 5 gigawatts of renewable energy around the world. Those agreements include more than 15 individual deals in Europe spanning Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, and Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Finland, we recently announced <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/europe/2022/03/17/microsoft-announces-intent-to-build-a-new-datacenter-region-in-finland-accelerating-sustainable-digital-transformation-and-enabling-large-scale-carbon-free-district-heating/#:~:text=In%20a%20unique%20collaboration%20with%20Fortum%20Corporation%2C%20the,scheme%20to%20recycle%20waste%20heat%20from%20data%20centers.\" target=\"_blank\">an important heat reuse project</a> that will take excess heat from our datacenters and transfer that heat to the local districts&rsquo; heating systems that can be used for both domestic and commercial purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To reduce waste from our datacenters in EMEA, the Circular Center <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/learn-how-microsoft-circular-centers-are-scaling-cloud-supply-chain-sustainability/\">we opened in Amsterdam</a> in 2020, which has since already delivered an 83 percent reuse of end-of-life datacenter assets and components. This is progress towards our target of 90 percent reuse and recycling of all servers and components for all cloud hardware by 2025. In addition, in January 2022, we opened a Circular Center in Dublin, Ireland, and have plans to open another Circular Center in Sweden to serve the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we continue to seek out efficiencies in our operations, recently we turned to nature for inspiration, to understand how much of the natural ecosystem we could replenish on the site of a datacenter, essentially integrating the datacenter into nature with the goal of renewing and revitalizing the surrounding area so that we can restore and create a pathway to provide regenerative value for the local community and environment. In the Netherlands we have begun construction of a lowland forested area around the datacenter as well as forested wetland. This was done to support the growth of native plants to mirror a healthy, resilient ecosystem and support biodiversity, improve storm water control and prevent erosion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/84d145f4-1a4a-4623-bbe2-f88ee8de3843.png\"><img alt=\"Rendering of a biomimicry project in the Netherlands showing a concept of using nature to cover the datacenter.

In June 2022, we launched our <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/en-sg/2022/09/07/opening-doors-to-a-sustainable-future-with-microsofts-circular-center-in-singapore/\">Singapore Circular Center</a> that is capable of processing up to 3,000 servers per month for reuse, or 36,000 servers annually. We have plans to open additional Circular Centers in Australia and South Korea in fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Across our datacenters in APAC, <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/en-au/features/microsoft-takes-another-key-step-to-reduce-data-centre-emissions-in-anz\" target=\"_blank\">we have formed partnerships with local energy providers</a> for renewable energy that is sourced from wind, solar, and hydro power and we have plans to further these partnerships and investments in renewable energy. In our forthcoming datacenter region in <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/en-nz/2022/08/18/conscious-cloud-our-aotearoa-datacenter-pledge-microsofts-datacenter-region-powered-by-100-carbon-free-energy-from-day-one/\">New Zealand</a>, we have signed an agreement that will enable Microsoft to power all of its datacenters with 100 percent renewable energy from the day it opens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Innovating to design the hyperscale datacenter of the future</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What these examples from across our global datacenter portfolio show is our ongoing commitment to make our global Microsoft datacenters more sustainable and efficient, enabling our customers to do more with less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our objective moving forward is to continue providing transparency across the entire datacenter lifecycle about how we infuse principles of reliability, sustainability, and innovation at each step of the datacenter design, construction, and operations process.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Design</strong>: How do we ensure we design for reliability, efficiency, and sustainability, to help reduce our customers&#39; scope three emissions?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Construction</strong>: How do we reduce embodied carbon and create a reliable supply chain?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Operation</strong>: How do we infuse innovative green technologies to decarbonize and operate to the efficient design standards?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Decommissioning</strong>: How do we recycle and reuse materials in our datacenters?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Community</strong>: How do we partner with the community and operate as good neighbors?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We have started by sharing datacenter region-specific data around carbon, water, waste, ecosystems, and community development and we will continue to provide updates as Microsoft makes further investments globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Learn more</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can learn more about our global datacenter footprint across the 60+ datacenter regions by visiting <a href=\"https://datacenters.microsoft.com\">datacenters.microsoft.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>View our Microsoft datacenter <a href=\"https://aka.ms/SustainabilityFactsheets\">factsheets</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more about <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/sustainability/#overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure sustainability</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>Discover <a href=\"https://aka.ms/WAF/sustainability\" target=\"_blank\">new sustainability guidance in the Azure Well-Architected Framework</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>Take a <a href=\"https://aka.ms/virtualdatacentertour\">virtual tour</a> of Microsoft&rsquo;s datacenters.</li>\r\n</ul>",

          "content:encoded": "<p><em>This post was co-authored by Sacha Abinader, Managing Director, Accenture and Keith Armstrong, Senior Manager, Accenture Microsoft Business Group.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Accelerate decision-making and interoperability with the OSDU Data Platform</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The OSDU&trade; Forum is a cross-industry collaboration to develop a common, standards-based, and open platform for the exploration and production (E&amp;P) community with the goal to liberate and enable greater access and insight into your valuable data. The OSDU Data Platform promise is compelling and offers value beyond what can be achieved with in-house solutions through established industry standards and openness to the larger technology ecosystem. Accenture has partnered with Microsoft and collaborated closely with Schlumberger during the Microsoft Energy Data Services preview and development process. In addition to Accenture&rsquo;s domain expertise and digital integration acumen, the preview experience has allowed Accenture to develop skills and scale a team specific to this offering to enable an operator&rsquo;s OSDU Data Platform journey at pace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, the OSDU Data Platform as an industry solution has been a top priority for Accenture with significant investments in skills, people, assets, and our presence and leadership as part of the OSDU Forum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&ldquo;<em>We are thrilled to be a services partner for Microsoft Energy Data Services. The partnership with Microsoft and Schlumberger in enabling an open platform has been wonderful. As part of preview, Accenture has been driving for interoperability across the technology ecosystem to bridge siloed teams and has partnered with Schlumberger and several ISVs to make this a reality. We are excited to enable operators to create additional value through improved and accelerated decision making and the development of new workflows and analytics.</em>&rdquo;&mdash;Emma Wild, Managing Director, Global OSDU Lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accenture has been actively involved in the OSDU Data Platform initiative for several years. In addition to our commitment to the OSDU Forum, we have developed our own vision and strategy as to how we can support OSDU Data Platform integration into E&amp;P workflows and how we can increase operators&#39; business capability and data value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Accenture understands our clients&rsquo; challenges and is their partner for complex transformations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our partners and clients want access to secure, clean, and curated data. To achieve this, they must liberate and migrate their data to the OSDU Data Platform. Our clients are dealing with large and highly complex data sets that have varying quality and formats. They also need to manage their ongoing business using the current and future capabilities of the OSDU Data Platform with its continual improvements of new data types and features. Accenture has planned a strategy that supports the transition from monolithic apps and data to the OSDU Data Platform at pace. Accenture and Microsoft are partners on this transformational journey as seen in <em>Figure 1.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/27aed989-3e54-4fac-a52e-812aaaa1b81f.png\"><img alt=\"Accenture’s OSDU capabilities and differentiators, Data Migration, Business Continuity, Data to Insights and Scale to business value at pace\" border=\"0\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/bebca100-3fda-45ac-ba69-4a0a37bed84f.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"Picture1a\" width=\"1024\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Our vision, your value</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To be successful we believe there is a need to create and support a solution that provides an end-to-end business capability, focusing on <strong>business value</strong> and <strong>time-to-value acceleration</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/a62b3e37-2047-4ea4-bce2-37509ad554d9.png\"><img alt=\"Accelerating business value through data by finding, validating and preparing your data, improving data quality, accessing and visualizing, providing a one stop data shop, emerging technologies and analytics and providing enhanced business capabilities  \" border=\"0\" height=\"194\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/b53eee04-cc37-4b7b-88e5-28f35901f87f.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"Picture2a\" width=\"1024\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our approach will quickly prepare and present data to the user via the OSDU Data Platform irrespective of its current functionality and capability. By integrating and consolidating data in a standard format and enabling the interoperability of the platform across ISVs, operators can unlock the milestones to the right of the diagram and deliver the accelerated value they&rsquo;ve been promised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We think of it as supporting a data life cycle and journey to mitigate perceived risks due to the evolving nature of the OSDU Data Platform while continually improving your business workflows.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why choose Microsoft Energy Data Services?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We recognize the complexity and risks involved in the transition and migration to the OSDU Data Platform. While energy companies have always managed E&amp;P risk and uncertainty, there is generally a much lower appetite when it comes to IT and digital platforms. As a result, the industry is increasingly seeking packaged solutions or out-of-the-box delivery structures. This enables them to realize the visions promised by the OSDU Data Platform yet still focus on the &quot;day job&quot; and running their operations and business. These solutions and structures help de-risk the journey and minimize disruption to business continuity. Recognizing this, Microsoft developed an open-packaged solution to offer the OSDU Data Platform as a PaaS through Microsoft Energy Data Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft Energy Data Services was designed to support the energy industry&rsquo;s ambition to accelerate innovation, develop enhanced insights to drive operational efficiency, and inform new ways of working and workflows. Microsoft Energy Data Services can accelerate the journey to a cloud-based OSDU Data Platform and thus, the path to value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Accenture and Microsoft Energy Data Services collaboration</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Accenture has helped deploy and test Microsoft Energy Data Services through the preview stages to provide feedback to Microsoft Engineering. Accenture is focused on connecting data to business value and working with Microsoft to deliver a fully integrated approach using the OSDU Data Platform to accelerate digital transformation. Accenture demonstrated this during the preview by deploying the Microsoft Energy Data Services solution, ingesting data with OSDU core service tools and Accenture proprietary tools, and stitching together a data workflow across multiple ISVs to validate the openness of the platform. During this process, Accenture has built a team that can help deploy and scale on Microsoft Energy Data Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft Energy Data Services differentiates itself as it will allow and enable:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Integration with virtually any energy dataset, application, or cloud service with built-in tools.</li>\r\n\t<li>Management for compute-intensive workloads at a global scale.</li>\r\n\t<li>Compliance with the OSDU Technical Standard for open source innovation.</li>\r\n\t<li>Ease the deployment of the OSDU Data Platform while providing ongoing platform and management support to align to OSDU Data Platform deployments.</li>\r\n\t<li>Rapid data ingestion for analytics and decision-making.</li>\r\n\t<li>Increase operational efficiency and gain global scalability while reducing operational costs.</li>\r\n\t<li>Comprehensive security and compliance.</li>\r\n\t<li>Ability to easily leverage native Azure and Microsoft solutions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft Energy Data Services further builds on and enables the OSDU Data Platform value drivers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The ability to access clean and curated historical data under a single data platform.</li>\r\n\t<li>Open access to innovation and a wider set of technology partners (ISVs).</li>\r\n\t<li>Removes siloes and barriers between disciplines and lays the foundation for digital transformation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Accenture&rsquo;s specific capabilities and toolkit</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Data on its own is not the answer, and Accenture has been working hard to offer end-to-end services and tools which connect the full enterprise and business.

These organizations serve global markets in the industries of manufacturing, energy, and financial services.&nbsp;According to the aggregated data, Azure Arc demonstrated:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A 206 percent return on investment (ROI) over three years with payback in less than six months.</li>\r\n\t<li>A 30 percent gain in productivity for IT Operations team members.</li>\r\n\t<li>An 80 percent reduction in risk of data breach from unsecured infrastructure.</li>\r\n\t<li>A 15 percent reduction in spending on third-party tools, saving on expenses.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Forrester study provides a framework for organizations wanting to evaluate the potential financial impact on their organizations of using Azure Arc for infrastructure security and governance. Forrester found that organizations with hybrid or multicloud strategies can realize productivity gains and reduce security risks by using Microsoft Azure Arc to secure and govern non-Azure infrastructure alongside Azure resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Productivity gains with Azure Arc&rsquo;s single-pane view</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The organizations in Forrester&rsquo;s study reported that after implementing Azure Arc, their IT Operations personnel realized a <strong>30 percent gain in productivity</strong> from savings in time spent on regular duties such as configuring and updating infrastructure, managing policies and permissions, troubleshooting, and resolving issues, and other tasks that don&rsquo;t directly drive business. With Azure Arc, IT teams can observe, secure, and govern diverse infrastructure and applications from a single pane of glass in Azure&mdash;leveraging Azure services enables them to be more agile, respond more efficiently, and frees time to serve business interests with higher-value tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&ldquo;<em>We&rsquo;re just making everyone&rsquo;s lives so much easier so they can do other things. If there is an issue, for example, you don&rsquo;t have to spend a week troubleshooting.</em>&rdquo;&mdash;Architect, Cloud products, Energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cost savings and streamlined infrastructure through the Azure portal</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Most organizations today run a mix of applications in on-premises datacenters, in the cloud, and at the edge. These disparate environments often result in investments in multiple management tools specific to the technology platforms, resulting in tool sprawl and excessive costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By moving to a single view of infrastructure and resources in the Azure portal enabled by Azure Arc, organizations could eliminate their legacy management tools, reducing licensing expenditures and eliminating costly on-premises management infrastructure. With Azure&rsquo;s flexible consumption-based pricing, they are no longer locked into long-term contracts or capacity limits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The composite organization in the Forrester study saved $900,000 in year three from reduced spending on third-party tools&mdash;<strong>a 15 percent decrease.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>&quot;</em><i>When I do dive in, I actually have a faster understanding of [our infrastructure]. So the benefit to me is that I have greater visibility</i>&mdash;<i>I need to ask [the team] fewer questions. The [Azure Arc] dashboard is [&hellip;] very easy.</i><em>&quot;</em>&mdash;VP of IT, Finance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel modernize security operations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Azure Arc helps organizations combat rapidly evolving security threats with increased efficiency by enabling the use of Microsoft security services such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel across hybrid and multicloud environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forrester found that the composite&nbsp;organization lowered the<strong> risk of a data breach from unsecured infrastructure by 80 percent</strong> after adopting Azure Arc and Microsoft security services. After onboarding Azure Arc, the organization uncovered noncompliant assets running on-premises or in edge environments and updated them to the latest security standards. This results in the savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars that would have been spent otherwise on managing breaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>&quot;With Azure Arc, we gained real insights into our infrastructure, including infrastructure [another cloud provider]. That helped us identify architecture [gaps] as well as controls to improve security compliance. [With Azure Arc], we found that around 20 percent of our infrastructure had been noncompliant.&quot;</em>&mdash;Deputy IT Director, Manufacturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Learn more</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Azure Arc is a bridge that extends the Azure platform to help customers build applications and services with the flexibility to run across datacenters, at the edge, and in multicloud environments.

Most companies have leveraged these technologies to create chatbots for managing customer questions and complaints, streamlining operations, and removing some of the heavy cost burden that comes with headcount. But what you may not realize is they&rsquo;re also being used internally to reduce risk and identify fraudulent behavior, reduce customer complaints, increase automation, and analyze customer sentiment. It&rsquo;s prevalent in most places, but especially in industries such as healthcare, finance, retail, and telecommunications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NVIDIA recently released the latest version of the <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo/megatron\" target=\"_blank\">NVIDIA NeMo Megatron</a> framework, which is <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-megatron-open-beta\" target=\"_blank\">now in open beta</a>. This framework can be used to build and deploy large language models (LLMs) with natural language understanding (NLU).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combining NVIDIA NeMo Megatron with our <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com//free/ai/\">Azure AI infrastructure</a> offers a powerful platform that anyone can spin up in minutes without having to incur the costs and burden of managing their own on-premises infrastructure.

These instances have the most GPU memory capacity and bandwidth, backed by NVIDIA InfiniBand HDR connections to support scaling up and out. Ultimately, <strong>we ran a 530B-parameter benchmark on 175 virtual machines, resulting in a training time per step of as low as 55.7 seconds</strong> (figure1). This benchmark measures the compute efficiency and how it scales by measuring the time taken per step to train the model after steady state is reached, with a mini-batch size of one. Such outstanding speed would not have been possible without InfiniBand HDR providing excellent communication between nodes without increased latency.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/c6e5ee26-69a4-4967-b0a9-c85361dfc857.png\"><img alt=\"The graph shows Azure’s performance results on the GPT-3 530 billion-parameter model with NVIDIA NeMo Megatron.

          "content:encoded": "<p>Today we are excited to make announcements in multiple areas of Azure Virtual WAN (vWAN), networking as a service that brings networking, security, and routing functionalities together to provide a single operational interface. As enterprises increasingly adopt the cloud while reducing their costs, IT teams looking to consolidate, accelerate, or even revamp their wide area network should consider Azure Virtual WAN. You don&#39;t need to have all these use cases to start using Virtual WAN&mdash;you can get started with just one. With ease of use and simplicity built in, vWAN is a one-stop shop to connect, protect, route traffic, and monitor your wide area network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&ldquo;<em>Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN is driving outcomes for Accenture. Migrating 250+ corporate networks to Virtual WAN with code-based deployments creates flexible, cheaper, and consistent networks for our customers. We can now easily connect new work sites in hours.</em>&rdquo;&mdash;Conrad Johnson, Cloud Networks Service Director, Accenture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following areas have key announcements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Remote user connectivity (also known as point-to-site VPN).</li>\r\n\t<li>Routing.</li>\r\n\t<li>Branch connectivity (also known as site-to-site VPN).</li>\r\n\t<li>Private connectivity (also known as ExpressRoute).</li>\r\n\t<li>Third-Party Network Virtual Appliance Integrations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Remote-user connectivity (also known as point-to-site VPN)</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Multipool user group support preview</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Multipool user group support for remote-user (point-to-site) VPN allows you to assign different IP address pools to connecting users based on their credentials. With this feature, you can segment your remote users into distinct groups, assign each group unique IP addresses and use the assigned IPs to control and restrict access to business-critical applications hosted both in Azure and on-premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>User groups within a Virtual WAN can be defined based on Azure Active Directory membership, Certificate Common Name domain or custom RADIUS attributes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/5a78e810-a345-43c1-b9ef-e25080ab8e9a.png\"><img alt=\"FigureA\" border=\"0\" height=\"522\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/5397c58b-bb38-47ad-8b3e-2a1e10b1ccbb.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"FigureA\" width=\"1024\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example, Contoso corporation has three departments, human resources, finance, and engineering. Contoso also has an on-premises datacenter hosting several business applications connected to Virtual WAN via an ExpressRoute circuit. Contoso leverages Azure Active Directory groups and Virtual WAN remote user/point-to-site VPN groups to segment and assigns different IPs to HR, finance, and engineering users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contoso then configures Azure Firewall and on-premises Firewall rules to allow each functional department to only access relevant applications. For example, Azure Firewall is configured to restrict access to applications in the HR VNet to HR Users. Likewise, on-premises firewalls are also configured to allow users access to applications based on need.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>To learn more, read about the underlying <a href=\"https://aka.ms/multipoolsconcept\" target=\"_blank\">concepts behind remote-user connectivity</a> and watch a <a href=\"https://aka.ms/multipoolstutorial\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step tutorial</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"Routing\" name=\"Routing\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Routing</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Secure hub routing intent preview</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Routing intent and routing policies allow you to simplify securing your Azure Virtual WAN deployments. With a single click, you can send all traffic (including inter-region and branch-to-branch) to be inspected by Azure Firewall or select Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) Network Virtual Appliances deployed in the virtual WAN hub. Virtual WAN&rsquo;s router manages this all for you dynamically by using BGP so that you can avoid error-prone configurations.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/f6908866-a316-468d-a07d-41685b64121b.png\"><img alt=\"FigureBandC\" border=\"0\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/651dc7a2-2104-43da-9a90-9ef4123c3c55.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"FigureBandC\" width=\"1024\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Configuring a routing policy on a hub makes that hub a regional security boundary&mdash;all traffic entering or leaving that hub will be sent to Azure Firewall or NVA of choice for inspection before being forwarded to its destination. Routing policies allow you to deploy Azure Firewall/NVA as a bump-in-the-wire solution to inspect East-West (VNet-to-VNet, branch-to-branch (ExpressRoute, P2S VPN, S2S VPN), North-South (branch-to-VNet) traffic between resources connected to the same hub and different hubs. Azure Firewall or a Network virtual appliance Firewall can also serve as the egress point for internet traffic for Virtual Networks and on-premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For more information on how to use routing intent and policies, please see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-wan/how-to-routing-policies\" target=\"_blank\">how to configure Virtual WAN Hub routing policies</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>For a list of available Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) NVA&rsquo;s deployed in the hub and appropriate instructions for deploying and accessing previews, please see our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-wan/about-nva-hub#partners\" target=\"_blank\">Network Virtual Appliances</a> documentation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hub routing preference (HRP) is generally available</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When a virtual hub router learns multiple routes across S2S VPN, ER, and SD-WAN NVA connections for a destination route prefix on-premises, the virtual hub router makes routing decisions using a built-in route selection algorithm. Being able to select virtual hub routing preference provides the ability to influence routing decisions in a virtual hub router for traffic flowing towards on-premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/6d3b5fb8-43f6-4209-a3e2-6ffbe1b5a096.png\"><img alt=\"FigureD\" border=\"0\" height=\"561\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/fb1a6525-bad6-4222-a9ec-53d1765564e6.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"FigureD\" width=\"1024\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hub routing preference gives you more control over your infrastructure by allowing you to select how your traffic is routed when a virtual hub router learns multiple routes across S2S VPN, ER and SD-WAN NVA connections. Hub routing preference provides the ability to select between ExpressRoute, AS Path, and VPN to create your desired traffic flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Routes are selected in the following order:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Select routes with Longest Prefix Match (LPM).</li>\r\n\t<li>Prefer static routes over BGP routes.</li>\r\n\t<li>Hub routing preference lets you select between ExpressRoute, AS Path, and VPN.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For more information on hub routing preference, please see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-wan/about-virtual-hub-routing-preference\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual WAN virtual hub routing preference - Preview - Azure Virtual WAN | Microsoft Learn</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bypass next hop IP for workloads within a spoke VNet connected to the virtual WAN hub generally available</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of Virtual WANs most popular routing use cases is deploying an NVA in a spoke VNet attached to a virtual WAN hub, then routing traffic through the NVA. Bypassing next hop IP for workloads within a spoke VNet connected to the virtual WAN hub lets you deploy and access other resources in the VNet with your NVA without any additional configuration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/658258d6-0167-40f8-8d5d-272b03b1ed78.png\"><img alt=\"FigureE\" border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/1ab3ada2-95e7-49a5-b497-ecf4e5aed1f6.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"FigureE\" width=\"545\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bypassing next hop IP for workloads within a spoke VNet connected to the virtual WAN hub allows you to have greater flexibility in how you deploy NVAs.

This feature now eliminates the need to configure static routes between a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) and the virtual hub router.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BGP Peering with a virtual hub enables you to deploy an NVA in a spoke VNet and dynamically exchange routes with your branch and on-premises sites. You can then peer that same NVA with the virtual hub dynamically using BGP. Now you can exchange routes between your branch and the virtual hub without using static routes!</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Read more <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-wan/scenario-bgp-peering-hub\" target=\"_blank\">about BGP peering with a virtual hub </a>on Microsoft Learn.</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn how to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-wan/create-bgp-peering-hub-portal\" target=\"_blank\">configure BGP peering to an NVA virtual hub</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Branch connectivity (also known as site-to-site VPN)</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>BGP dashboard is now generally available</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The BGP dashboard provides the ability to monitor BGP peers, advertised routes, and learned routes for your site-to-site VPNs configured to use BGP in one place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/f94a8193-583f-4c2e-81fb-cfe4e4984b98.png\"><img alt=\"Figure G\" border=\"0\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/9e5c465b-1b33-4bde-a4a3-f4c6a4df5f67.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"Figure G\" width=\"1024\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BGP dashboard provides greater visibility into your branch offices connected to Virtual WAN.

Earlier, this feature was only available for regions having availability zones. The following gateway SKUs can be used for setting up VPN connectivity:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>VpnGw1/2/3/4/5 SKUs with standard public IP for regions with no availability zones</li>\r\n\t<li>VpnGw1AZ/2AZ3AZ/4AZ/5AZ SKUs with standard public IP for regions having one or more availability zones</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Point-to-site users connecting to a virtual network gateway can use ExpressRoute (via the site-to-site tunnel) to access on-premises resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Customers can deploy site-to-site VPN connections over ExpressRoute private peering at the same time as site-to-site VPN connection via the Internet on the same VPN gateway.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Read <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/site-to-site-vpn-private-peering?toc=/azure/expressroute/toc.json\" target=\"_blank\">more information on this new feature</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Custom traffic selectors (portal)&ndash;generally available</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Customers may want to set traffic selectors to narrow down address prefixes from both ends of a VPN tunnel. Custom traffic selectors are particularly useful for customers who have large VNet address spaces but want to use one of their subnets for IPsec/IKE negotiation. Customers can add custom traffic selectors when creating a new connection or update an existing connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier, we enabled custom traffic selectors using PowerShell. Customers can now also use the portal to set custom traffic selectors on their Virtual Network Gateway VPN connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>TrafficSelectorPolicy</em> parameter consists of an array of traffic selectors, with each traffic selector holding a collection of local and remote address ranges in CIDR format.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>See more information on <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal#configure-connect\" target=\"_blank\">setting up traffic selectors</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>High availability for Azure VPN client using secondary profile is generally available</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Customers can now use Azure VPN client in Windows to add a secondary gateway preference in their primary gateway configuration. This feature improves connection availability for point-to-site customers by having a pre-configured additional profile. If for some reason, the primary gateway encounters an outage, VPN client will automatically failover to connect with the secondary gateway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/7f134e8c-fad9-4288-9240-edc8db2c8531.png\"><img alt=\"FigureJ\" border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/53c6e012-c579-408c-91f0-2c91706ba94a.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"FigureJ\" width=\"594\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>See more information on <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-vpn-client-cert-windows#configure-the-vpn-client-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Azure VPN client using secondary profile</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Private connectivity (also known as ExpressRoute)</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>ExpressRoute circuit with visibility of Virtual WAN connection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously in Azure Portal, when navigating to an ExpressRoute circuit connected to a Virtual WAN hub, the ExpressRoute circuit&rsquo;s <strong>Connections </strong>page did not display the connections to the virtual hub&rsquo;s ExpressRoute gateway. With this feature, these connections to the virtual hub&rsquo;s ExpressRoute gateways are now visible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By displaying these connections to the ExpressRoute gateways in the virtual hub, this feature provides you with more visibility into your Azure architecture.

In the preceding illustration, multi-region workloads running on Azure with Azure DNS Private Resolver are provisioned in two regional, centralized virtual networks with one or more spokes peered to each centralized virtual network. These virtual networks have inbound and outbound endpoints provisioned. From on-premises, there are two distinct locations (East and West) and each location connects via Express Route to the centralized virtual network where Private Resolver is provisioned. These on-premises locations have one or more local DNS servers configured to do conditional forwarding to the inbound endpoint of Private Resolver. The local DNS servers in East have the IP address of the East inbound endpoint as the primary DNS target, and the West inbound endpoint as secondary. Alternatively, the local DNS servers in West have the IP address of the West inbound endpoint as the primary DNS target, and the East inbound endpoint&nbsp;as secondary. There is a single private DNS zone linked to both regions and both on-premises locations can resolve names from this zone even in the event of a regional failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dns/private-dns-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Private DNS</a>: Azure Private DNS provides a reliable and secure DNS service for your virtual network. Azure Private DNS manages and resolves domain names in the virtual network without the need to configure a custom DNS solution. By using private DNS zones, you can use your own custom domain name instead of the Azure-provided names during deployment.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dns/dns-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Public DNS</a>: DNS domains in Azure DNS are hosted on Azure&#39;s global network of DNS name servers.

When we launched <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-vmware/\">Azure VMware Solution</a> two years ago amid a pandemic, IT agility became a top priority as organizations scrambled to enable remote work and ensure business resilience via cloud solutions. Fast forward to today, and most organizations recognize that by running workloads in the cloud, they can respond more rapidly, no matter what the challenge or opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much easier for us to take on smaller acquisitions and bring them onboard &hellip; by using Azure VMware Solution, we&rsquo;re always ready and able to add a node and start folding in the new acquisition&rsquo;s applications and data with the extra capacity.&rdquo;</em>&mdash;Dean Hughes, Infrastructure Manager, <a href=\"https://customers.microsoft.com/story/1508875931123061701-carpetright-retailers-azure\" target=\"_blank\">Carpetright</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>&ldquo;Ordering and installing on-premises networking hosts can take six months.

Azure VMware Solution offers symmetry with on-premises environments, which helps to accelerate datacenter migrations, so customers recognize the benefits of the cloud sooner. This symmetry also allows IT teams to leverage the same VMware skills, processes, and investments from their on-premises VMware environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>&ldquo;What a game-changer for us. As a VMware house, we saw how easy it would be to move applications from VMware to Azure VMware Solution because it&rsquo;s bolted onto the back of Azure.&rdquo;</em>&mdash;Rob Wilde, Platforms Manager, <a href=\"https://customers.microsoft.com/story/1477034973006130434-nottinghamshire-county-council-government-azure-vmware-solution\" target=\"_blank\">Nottinghamshire County Council</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Microsoft&rsquo;s unique Azure Hybrid Benefit and Extended Security Updates for Windows Server and SQL Server, Azure VMware Solution is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to seamlessly migrate and run VMware in the cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Option coming for VMware Cloud Universal Program</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Today we extended our partnership with VMware to add support for the VMware Cloud Universal program.
